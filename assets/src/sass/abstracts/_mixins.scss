This file is dedicated to Sass Mixins, which are blocks of CSS declarations grouped into reusable entities.
These mixins can then be included in other Sass files using the @include directive, enabling DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) methodologies in our stylesheets.

Mixins can take arguments, which allows us to produce a wide variety of styles with a few flexible, parameterized mixins.
This functionality makes them powerful tools for abstracting complex CSS patterns, or for generating multiple style variants from a base.

Whenever creating a new mixin or modifying an existing one, remember to document it well and note its usage and purpose.
Doing so will ensure others can quickly understand and utilize these abstracted styles in their own development.

	This file is used to contain all abstracts imports.
    This file serves as an aggregate of all the abstracts (settings, helpers, and functions) used across our stylesheets. 
    Abstracts are parts of our codebase that don't produce direct, tangible CSS output when compiled on their own.

// Vendor Styles
// These are third-party styles imported from libraries or frameworks.
// For instance, we're using WordPress's base styles here for a consistent and efficient starting point for our stylesheets.
// More details about each import are available in the 'vendor.scss' file.
@import "vendors";

// Variables
// This file contains the Sass variables used in the theme.
// These are pieces of data that can be reused across your stylesheets.
// Think of them as a way to store information that you want to reuse throughout your site.
// You can store things like colors, fonts, or any other CSS values you think you'll want to reuse.
@import "variables";

// Mixins
// Mixins are a way of reusing a whole bunch of properties at once, or even whole CSS rules.
// You can even give them arguments which allows you to produce a wide variety of styles with very few mixins.
@import "mixins";
